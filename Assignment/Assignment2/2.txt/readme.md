  Chapter 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

                                   (Group A)
                          
1.Define the term "Sitemap" in the planning phnase.
Ans: In the plannihng phase,a sitemap acts as a crucial blueprint,visually mapping out a website's entire structure , content hierarchy, and a user flows to ensure logical navigation and scope understanding before development starts.

2.What is the purpose of "Launch" phase in web development?
Ans: The purpose of "Launch" phase in web development,is to make the website live and accessible to users on the internet after testing and a final approval.

3.Why documentation is important in the development lifecycle?
Ans: Documentation is important in the development lifecycle, "source of truth" that prevents project failures by preserving the data ,information and knowledge for clarity, consistancy,and continuity as a reference for future work.

4.Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
Ans: Front-end development builds the visual interface and a user experience (what you see) , using htmal,css and javascript , while a back-end development manages the server , database, and logic (how it works) ,by using python, php, Nodejs and a Nextjs.

5."Planning is the most critical phase of web development ." Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
Ans:Planning is the most critical phase of web developement because it sets the foundation for the entire project,ensuring clear goals,structure , and a stragety before design or coding begins.
  The key activities performed during the planning phase are as follow:                
- Requirement Analysis
- Target Audience Analysis
- Scope Defination
- Content Planning
- Sitemap and Navigation Planning
- Technology Selection
- UI/UX Strategy
- Timeline and Buget Estiamtion
- Risk Analysys

6.Explain the iterative nature of the Maintaince phase. Why is a website never truly "finished"?
Ans:The maintainance phase is iterative because it involves continious monitoring , updating, and improvement of the website after launch.

   A website is never truly "finished" because user needs change, content must be updated , technologies evolve, security threats emerge, and bugs or performance issues srise over time. Therefore,websites require regular updates, fixes and enhancements to remain secure , functional, and revelent.
     
7.Describe the process of "Information gathering".why is understanding  the target auidence crucial during this step?
Ans:Information gathering is the first step of web development where developers collect detailed information about the client's goals,business needs, website purpose, required features , content, and technical constraints . this includes discussions with stakeholders, requorement analysis, and reviewing existing systems or competitors.

    Understanding the target audience is crucial during this step because the website must be designed to meet user's neeeds, preferencences, and behavior. Knowing who the user's are helps in choosing the right content , layout, navigation, language, and features,ensuring better usability , engagement, and overall sucess of a website.

                              (Group C)   

8.You are the project manager for a new commerece site. The  cliet wants to skip the "Testing" phase to save the money and launch early . write a persuative argument explaining the potential risks(security , functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.
Ans: If I was the manager , I would say that Skipping the testing phase may way seem like a time saving and money saving ,but it introduces serious risks  that can ultimately cost far more after launch .

-Security Risks:
Skippping testing can leave srcurity vulnerabilities undetected, such as weak login systems or insure payment gateways, which may lead to data breaches and losss of customer trust.

-Functionality Issues:
Critical features like product search, cart, checkout, and payment process may not work correctly , resulting in failed  orders and revenue loss.

-Compatibility Problems:
The website may not fuction properly across different browsers,devices, or screen sizes, causing a poor user exprience.

-Poor User Experience:
Bugs, slow loading pages, or broken links can frustrate users and drive them away.

-Higher Long-Term Costs:
Fixing issues after launch is more expenssive and time-consuming than resolving them during the testing phase.

9.A developer begins a coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototypeor sitemap. Midwayb through , the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong with the processand how it should have been handled. 
Ans:What went wrong in the process:

-No proper planning:
The developer skipped the plannig phase, including sitemap creation and layout plannig.

-Lack of design prototype/wireframe:
Without wireframes or mockups , the client could not visualize the website structure and layout early.

-Unclear requirements:
Client expectations were not fully documented or confirmed before development began.

-No client validation:
The client was not given a chance to review and approve the design before coding started.

-Wasted time and cost:
Coding without approval led to rework when the client rejected the layout.

How it should have been handled:
- Information gathering first:
 Clearly understand client goals, target auidence, and functional requirements.

- Create sitemap and wireframes:
  Plan page strucutre and navigation before development.

- Develop a  design prototype:
  Show visual mockups to help the client understand the final look.

-Client review and approval:
 Get formal approval on the design and struture before coding.

- Start coding
  Begin coding only after the layout and flow are finalized.

10.A university website was launched sucessfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules wereoutdated.Which phase of development lifecycle was neglected.Explain the activities involved in this phase.
Ans:The maintenance phase of the web development lifecycle was neglected.
   Explaination
   The maintaionance phase focuses on keeping the website updated,accurate, and functional after launch. in this cause, exam schedules were not updated regurly , making the information unreliable and causing students to stop using the website.

   Activities involved in the maintenance phase:
  - Content updates:
    Regularly updating exam schedules,notices, announcements,and academic information.
    
  - Monitoring and review:
    Checking wheather the website content is accurate, revelent , and useful to users.
    
  - Bugs fixes:
    Identifying and fixing errors that appear after launch.
    
  - Performance optimization:
    Ensuring fast loading and smooth performance.
    
  -Security updates:
    Applying patches and updates to protect against vulnerabilities.
    Neglecting these activites leads to outdated content and loss of user trust , as seen in this scenario.
