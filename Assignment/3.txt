5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (sequencial) structure.Give an example of when to use each.
Ans: -Hierarchical (tree) structure organizes information in levels , with a main parent and multiple sub pages, making it suitable for large websites with many categories (eg. a university website with faculties -> departments -> cources). it allows easy navigation and clear relationships between pages.
    -Linear (sequencial) structure presents pages in a fixed order , one after another , making it ideal for step by step processes (e.g. an online exam , cheakout process, or tutorial). it is simple but offers limited navigation flexibility.

6.Explain the "Three click Rule" and its significance in user experience (UX) design.

9. A  user visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation menu, which is hidden behind a small icon on a desksktop screen .Analyize this design failure using the "KISS"(keep it simple ) principle.
Ans:Using the KISS (Keep it Simple) principle, this is a clear design failure:

- The navigation menu is hidden behind a samall icon , which is unnecessary on a desktop screen.
- KISS emphasizes simplicity and clarity, but hiding essential navigation makes the site harder to use.
- Users should not have to think or search for basic features like menus.
- This increases confusion and frustration , causing the user to leave quickly.
-A simple visible menu would make navigation obvious and improve usability.

10.An ecommerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod? idd=55&cat=9. Explain why this is bad for both users and Search Engine (SEo) and propose a better structure using page slugs.
Ans:The URL www.shop.com/prod?idd=55&cat=9 ids bad for users and SEO because:
Problems: 

-Unreadable and confusing for users- they cannot understand what the page is about.
-Not SEO friendly:search engine struggle to extract keywords from query parameters.
-Hard to share or remember: long query strings are inconvient.
Better Approach (using page slugs)
use descritive words separated by hypens.
ex:www.shop.com/laptops/dell-inspiron-15
